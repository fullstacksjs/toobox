# escapeRegex

Escapes regex chars

If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching
for a "_", for instance), you must escape it by putting a backslash in front of
it. For instance, to search for "a" followed by "_" followed by "b", you'd use
/a\*b/ â€” the backslash "escapes" the "\*", making it literal instead of special.
