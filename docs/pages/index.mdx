Welcome to Toolbox! a collection of missing helpers for all JavaScript runtimes.

## What is Toolbox?

A **zero-dependency** âš¡, **tree-shakable**ðŸŒ² pacakge for collection of missing
JavaScript utilities that works for All Javascript runtimes.

## Motivation

In the JavaScript, there is a significant lack of simple but essential
utilities. As a result, it's needed to duplicate codes or install numerous
third-party dependencies, many of which have unneeded utility dependents of
their own, creating dependency hell. ðŸ”¥

The **@fullstacksjs/toolbox** is designed to provide a set of simple yet
practical utilities in a single zero-dependency package.
