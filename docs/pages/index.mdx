Welcome to Toolbox! A **zero-dependency** 📦, **tree-shakable**🌲 collection of
missing JavaScript utilities.

## Why Toolbox?

- 📦️ **Zero-dependencies**: You only need one external library to replace all
  others.
- 🌲 **Efficient tree-shaking**: Adding just one function will only increase
  your bundle by 3 lines.
- 🏗️ **Modern**: works with ESM, Deno, NodeJS and browser
- 🧪 **Fully tested**: All functions are thoroughly tested with unit tests.
- 🥅 **Practical focus**: Only functions with practical applications are
  included in the library collection.

## Motivation

The `@fullstacksjs/toolbox` aims to provide a simple and practical solution to
the lack of essential utilities in JavaScript.

It eliminates the need for code duplication or excessive third-party
dependencies, simplifying the development process. Say goodbye 👋 to dependency
hell 🔥 and enjoy simplicity.
